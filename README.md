# OS_based_Assistant
on the basis of python os module, this assistant wil perform various operations for you

Hello everyone, 
     Hope you all are doing well. 
 Under the course "Specialist in Python (with Flask towards Data Science), Vimal Daga Sir has given us a problem. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èProblem is :- "Convert the OS based program into a menu driven program using Python Code which will execute the required user query when user will give the input as a text." 

So, I am sharing my approach to this problem, have a look. 
Solution - an OS based Assistant which perform various operations with perfect Error HandlingüòÑ. Also, this assistant will make these things interactive for you by speaking üó£. 
So various operations are - 
1. Work on files and folders
    ‚Ä¢ Create file (write content?) / folder
    ‚Ä¢ Delete file / folder
    ‚Ä¢ Rename file / folder
    ‚Ä¢ Read a file
2. Run chrome
    - Want to open a specific site? 
3. Open text editor
4. Want to about me
5. No operations(simply exit)
